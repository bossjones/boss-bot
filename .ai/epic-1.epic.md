# Epic-1: Core Bot Infrastructure

## Status
In Progress

## Description
This epic focuses on establishing the foundational infrastructure for the Boss-Bot Discord media download assistant. It includes setting up the development environment, implementing the core bot framework, establishing error handling and logging systems, and creating a comprehensive testing infrastructure.

## Goals
- Establish a solid development foundation with proper tooling and standards
- Implement core Discord bot functionality with proper event handling
- Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure with coverage targets
- Implement robust error handling and logging systems

## Success Criteria
1. Development environment is fully configured and documented
2. Discord bot connects and responds to basic commands
3. Test infrastructure achieves MVP coverage targets:
   - Core Download: 30%
   - Command Parsing: 25%
   - Discord Events: 20%
   - File Management: 20%
4. Error handling and logging provide clear visibility into system state

## Stories
1. Project Initialization and Environment Setup
   - Status: Draft
   - Set up project structure and development environment
   - Configure testing and documentation infrastructure

2. Test Infrastructure Setup
   - Status: Not Started
   - Set up pytest with all testing dependencies
   - Create test configuration and fixtures
   - Set up coverage reporting

3. Logging and Monitoring Setup
   - Status: Not Started
   - Implement logging system with loguru
   - Configure better-exceptions
   - Set up basic performance monitoring

4. Basic Discord Bot Setup
   - Status: Not Started
   - Create Discord application and bot user
   - Implement basic bot client
   - Set up environment configuration
   - Create connection and event handling

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.12+
- UV for package management
- Ruff for code quality
- Pytest for testing
- Discord.py v2.5.2+
- Loguru for logging
- Better-exceptions for error handling

## Dependencies
- None (This is the first epic)

## Risks
- Discord API changes could affect implementation
- Test coverage targets may be challenging for Discord events
- Integration testing complexity with Discord API

## Notes
- Follow TDD practices strictly
- Maintain clear documentation
- Ensure all code has proper type hints and docstrings
- Keep modules under 120 lines
- Use async/await patterns consistently

## Timeline
Estimated completion: 2024-05-22
