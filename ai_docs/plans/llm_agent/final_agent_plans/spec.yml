# --------------------------
# Excellent! I've created a comprehensive LangGraph specification file for Boss-Bot's multi-agent architecture. This spec captures the hybrid hierarchical-swarm design from your planning documents and translates it into a format that can be used
#   with the langgraph-gen-py tool.

#   üéØ What I Created

#   Key Architecture Components in the Spec:

#   üèóÔ∏è Hierarchical Structure

#   - MainSupervisor - Top-level orchestrator that routes requests based on type and system state
#   - Specialized Teams - Strategy selector, content analyzer, social media coordinator, media processing coordinator
#   - Platform Specialists - Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube handlers

#   üîÑ Swarm-Style Handoffs

#   - Dynamic agent-to-agent communication with conditional routing
#   - Fallback mechanisms when agents need specialized expertise
#   - Quality assessment feedback loops between processing and analysis agents

#   üìä Rich State Management

#   - Complete user context with preferences and Discord integration
#   - Comprehensive content metadata for multi-modal analysis
#   - Processing history and error tracking for audit trails

#   ‚öôÔ∏è Integration Points

#   - Direct integration with existing Epic 5 strategy pattern
#   - Discord command enhancement (smart-download, analyze, suggest-quality)
#   - Feature flag control for gradual AI rollout
#   - Fallback to traditional CLI/API methods

#   üöÄ Advanced Features

#   Conditional Routing Logic

#   - Content analysis confidence thresholds
#   - Platform-specific routing decisions
#   - Quality optimization triggers
#   - Error handling and recovery paths

#   Configuration Management

#   - AI model selections for different tasks
#   - Performance tuning parameters
#   - Platform and format support definitions
#   - Discord integration settings

#   üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

#   You can now use this spec with the langgraph-gen-py tool:

#   # Generate Python code from the spec
#   langgraph-gen ai_docs/plans/llm_agent/final_agent_plans/spec.yml

#   # Generate with custom output paths
#   langgraph-gen ai_docs/plans/llm_agent/final_agent_plans/spec.yml \
#     -o src/boss_bot/ai/agents/boss_bot_workflow.py \
#     --implementation src/boss_bot/ai/agents/boss_bot_impl.py

#   This will generate:
#   1. LangGraph workflow stub with all agent nodes and routing logic
#   2. Implementation template with function stubs for each agent node
#   3. Type-safe interfaces matching your planning documents

#   The generated code will provide a solid foundation for implementing the multi-agent architecture while maintaining integration with your existing Boss-Bot components! üéâ
