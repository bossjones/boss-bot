# Architecture for Boss-Bot: A Discord Media Download and RAG Assistant

Status: Draft

## Technical Summary

Boss-Bot is a Discord bot designed to provide reliable media download capabilities from platforms like Twitter and Reddit, with a foundation for future RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) features. The architecture follows a modular, event-driven design using Python 3.12 and discord.py as the core framework. The system implements a robust queue management system for downloads, comprehensive error handling, and a test-driven development approach.

## Technology Table

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Python 3.12 | Primary development language, chosen for strong async support and modern features |
| discord.py | Discord bot framework providing event handling and API integration |
| gallery-dl | Media download utility for Twitter, Reddit, and other platforms |
| yt-dlp | YouTube/video download utility for extended platform support |
| httpx | Modern HTTP client for async API interactions |
| pydantic | Data validation and settings management |
| loguru | Advanced logging with structured output |
| pytest | Testing framework with async support |
| ruff | Fast Python linter and formatter written in Rust |
| uv | Modern Python package manager for dependency management |

    participant U as User
    participant B as Bot
    participant Q as Queue
    participant D as Downloader
    participant F as FileSystem
    participant Di as Discord

    U->>B: $dlt command
    B->>Q: Add to queue
    Q->>B: Position update
    B->>U: Queue status
    Q->>D: Process download
    D->>F: Save file
    F->>Di: Upload file
    Di->>U: File link
```

## Data Models

### Core Models

```python
class DownloadItem(BaseModel):
    """Represents a single download request."""
    id: UUID
    url: HttpUrl
    status: DownloadStatus
    priority: DownloadPriority
    user_id: int
    guild_id: int
    channel_id: int
    created_at: datetime
    progress: float = 0.0
    total_size: Optional[int] = None
    error_message: Optional[str] = None

class QueueState(BaseModel):
    """Represents the current state of the download queue."""
    items: List[DownloadItem]
    active_downloads: int
    total_items: int
    queue_size: int
```
