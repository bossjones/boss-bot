# Epic 5: Strategy Pattern Integration

This memory file contains documentation about the Epic 5 strategy pattern implementation.

**When to include this context:**
- When working with download strategies
- When implementing new platform support
- When discussing API vs CLI modes
- When working with feature flags
- When understanding the download architecture

## Epic 5: Strategy Pattern Integration ✅ COMPLETED
The project has successfully implemented the experimental strategy pattern architecture for download operations, providing both CLI and API-direct modes with feature flag control.

### ✅ Completed Platforms & Strategies
- **Twitter/X Strategy** (`twitter_strategy.py`): Full CLI/API switching with feature flags, comprehensive test coverage
- **Reddit Strategy** (`reddit_strategy.py`): Complete implementation with API-direct support and fallback mechanisms
- **Instagram Strategy** (`instagram_strategy.py`): Full implementation with user CLI preferences (Firefox cookies, Wget/1.21.1 user agent)
- **YouTube Strategy** (`youtube_strategy.py`): Complete yt-dlp integration with quality selection and comprehensive metadata support

### Strategy Architecture (EXPERIMENTAL.md Epic 5)
- **Base Strategy**: `BaseDownloadStrategy` defines abstract interface for all download strategies
- **Feature Flag Control**: Environment variable-driven configuration for API vs CLI choice
- **Platform Detection**: URL pattern matching for automatic strategy selection
- **Integration Points**: Discord cog integration ✅, CLI command integration ✅, comprehensive test coverage ✅
- **Technology**: Uses gallery-dl/yt-dlp APIs directly (API mode) or subprocess calls (CLI mode)
- **Fallback System**: API failures automatically fallback to CLI when enabled

### Epic 5 Implementation Status
- ✅ **Story 5.1**: Discord cogs updated to use strategy pattern (`src/boss_bot/bot/cogs/downloads.py`)
- ✅ **Story 5.2**: CLI commands updated to use strategies (`src/boss_bot/cli/commands/download.py`)
- ✅ **Story 5.3**: Configuration documentation and usage examples (this section)
- ✅ **Story 5.4**: Gradual rollout via environment variables (feature flags system)
