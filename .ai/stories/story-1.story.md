# Epic-1 - Story-1
# Project Initialization and Environment Setup

**As a** developer
**I want** to set up the initial project structure and development environment with security and monitoring foundations
**so that** we have a solid, secure, and observable foundation for building the Boss-Bot Discord media download assistant

## Status

In Progress

## Context

This is the first story of Epic-1 (Core Bot Infrastructure) which sets up the foundational project structure and development environment. This story is critical as it establishes:

- Basic project structure following the defined layout ✅
- Development environment configuration 🚧
- Code quality tools and standards ✅
- Initial test infrastructure 🚧
- Documentation foundation ❌
- Security baseline 🚧
- Monitoring setup ✅
- CI/CD pipeline foundation ❌

Key technical decisions from the PRD and architecture documents:
- Python 3.12 as the primary development language ✅
- UV for package management ✅
- Ruff for code quality ✅
- Pytest for testing infrastructure ✅
- Comprehensive test coverage targets for MVP ✅ (Current: 56.16%, exceeding MVP targets)
- Loguru for logging ✅
- Better-exceptions for error handling ✅
- Security-first approach with proper environment variable handling 🚧
- Monitoring and metrics collection from the start ✅

## Estimation

Story Points: 5 (5 days human development = 50 minutes AI development)
Increased from 3 to 5 points due to additional security, monitoring, and CI/CD requirements.

## Deferred Tasks
The following tasks have been deferred to future phases:

1. Storage Management (Task Group 7)
   - Configure cleanup policies (Phase 2)
   - Configure backup locations (Phase 2)
   - Set up storage monitoring (Phase 2)
   - Configure storage security (Phase 3)

Rationale for Deferral:
- These features belong to later phases per phased development plan
- Not critical for MVP functionality
- Current focus is on core bot infrastructure and basic file validation

## Constraints

- Python 3.12+ required
- Maximum module size: 120 lines
- Test coverage targets (MVP):
  * Core Download: 30%
  * Command Parsing: 25%
  * Discord Events: 20%
  * File Management: 20%
- Maximum concurrent downloads: 5
- Maximum queue size: 50 items
- Maximum file size: 50MB
- Secure environment variable handling required
- Monitoring metrics must be collected from start
