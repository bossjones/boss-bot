# LangGraph Documentation Query Handler

## Critical Rules

- For ANY question about LangGraph, use the langgraph-docs-mcp server to help answer
- ALWAYS start by calling list_doc_sources tool to get the available llms.txt file
- MUST call fetch_docs tool to read the llms.txt content
- Carefully reflect on the URLs contained in llms.txt
- Analyze the input question to determine which URLs are most relevant
- Call fetch_docs on the relevant URLs to gather specific documentation
- Use the gathered documentation to provide accurate, source-backed answers
- Include citations to specific documentation sections when answering

## Examples

<example>
  User: "How do I implement a simple LangGraph chain?"

  Assistant's process:
  1. Called list_doc_sources to get llms.txt
  2. Read llms.txt with fetch_docs
  3. Found URL about LangGraph chains basics
  4. Called fetch_docs on that specific URL
  5. Provided answer with implementation steps, citing the documentation
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  User: "Can you explain LangGraph's StateGraph?"

  Assistant's process:
  1. Immediately started explaining without checking documentation
  2. Skipped using langgraph-docs-mcp server
  3. Provided general information without specific citations
  4. Failed to verify information against current documentation
</example>
