# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
Boss-Bot is an AI-powered Discord bot that enables intelligent downloading and managing of media files from social media platforms. The bot uses discord.py and follows a modular architecture with cogs for different functionality. It leverages advanced AI capabilities through LangChain, LangGraph, and multi-agent orchestration for intelligent content analysis, strategy selection, and workflow optimization.

## Build & Test Commands
- Run all tests: `just check-test`
- Run single test: `just check-test "tests/test_bot/test_client.py::test_function_name"`
- Run tests with coverage: `just check-coverage`
- Lint code: `just check-code`
- Type check: `just check-type`
- Format code: `just format`
- Full check suite: `just check`
- Manage dependencies: `just uv-update`
- Run bot: `goobctl go`

**Important**: All Python commands should be prefixed with `uv run` when running outside of just commands:
- Run pytest directly: `uv run python -m pytest <test_path>`
- Run CLI commands: `uv run python -m boss_bot.cli.main <command>`
- Run Python scripts: `uv run python <script.py>`

## Code Architecture
- `BossBot` (in `src/boss_bot/bot/client.py`) is the main bot class extending discord.ext.commands.Bot
- `BossSettings` (in `src/boss_bot/core/env.py`) manages configuration via pydantic-settings
- Discord commands are organized into cogs (src/boss_bot/bot/cogs/)
- CLI interface using Typer in `src/boss_bot/cli.py` (currently in development)
- Core services:
  - `QueueManager`: Manages download queue
  - `DownloadManager`: Handles concurrent downloads
- All settings are accessible via dependency injection from the bot instance

## Technology Stack
- **Discord.py**: Core framework for Discord bot functionality
- **Pydantic/Pydantic-Settings**: Data validation and environment configuration
- **Typer**: CLI interface (partially implemented)
- **Rich**: Console output formatting for CLI
- **AI & LangChain Ecosystem**:
  - **LangChain**: Framework for AI chain development and agent coordination
  - **LangGraph**: Multi-agent orchestration and workflow state management
  - **LangSmith**: Monitoring, debugging, and tracing LLM applications
  - **LangChain Integrations**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (Gemini) model providers
  - **Multi-Agent Architecture**: StrategySelector, ContentAnalyzer, SocialMediaAgent
- **Testing**: pytest, pytest-asyncio, dpytest, pytest-recording (VCR for AI)
- **Storage**: Support for various storage mechanisms
- **Build System**: Just, uv, ruff

## Code Style Guidelines
- Python 3.12+ with type hints throughout
- Use Discord.py and Pydantic patterns for Discord bot and data validation
- Imports: Use `ruff` import sorting (sorted, grouped by stdlib/third-party/local)
- Formatting: 120 character line length with Google docstring style
- Error handling: Use proper exception handling and logging
- File organization: Follow the existing module structure in src/boss_bot/
- Use dependency injection patterns with settings passed via constructor
- Add linter directives at top of files when necessary
- Use SecretStr for sensitive values and proper validation in Pydantic models

## Common Patterns
- Command handling: Use discord.ext.commands decorators in cogs
- Error handling: Implement specific handlers for different command errors
- Configuration: Use environment variables via BossSettings
- Resource management: Clean up resources in close() or teardown methods
- Testing: Create isolated fixtures with appropriate scope and teardown logic
- Async/await: Use async for all I/O operations and Discord API calls
